# Flow
Flow adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality.  http://flowtype.org/

As usual facebook has some great learning tools, check it out: [http://tryflow.org/](http://tryflow.org/)

## Start

The best place to start is always:

```
$ npm i -g flow-bin
/usr/local/bin/flow -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/flow-bin/cli.js
/usr/local/lib
└── flow-bin@0.33.0

$ flow --help
```

The default command is:

```
$ flow

--> flow status
# (default) Shows current Flow errors by asking the Flow server
```
